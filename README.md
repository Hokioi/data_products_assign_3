# Assignment 3 for the Developing Data Products course on Coursera
## 27 July, 2019

This repo contains my R scripts for ssignment 3 of the Coursera course: Developing Data Products.

For this assignment I create a Shiny app that shows pill testing results from KnowYourStuffNZ.

The app can be found at: https://hokioi.shinyapps.io/KYSNZ_1819_results/ 

The ui and server side code for the app are contained within the single script: app.R
Creating Shiny apps in a single script became supported in Shiny v0.10.2 and this is now a more normal approach than 
separating code into ui.R and server.R scripts. I believe that the Developing Data Products assignment 3 requirements
have not been updated to reflect this.
